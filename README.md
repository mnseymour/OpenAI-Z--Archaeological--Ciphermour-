# Ciphermour Protocol – Quantum Archaeology with OpenAI

## Abstract
This project uses OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 and satellite imagery to identify lost Amazonian cities. We fused indigenous lore, historical records, and geospatial anomaly detection in a reproducible pipeline.

## Data Sources
- Sentinel-2 imagery
- OpenTopography LIDAR
- GlobalXplorer
- GPT-4.1 AI outputs

## Key Discoveries
Identified 26 potential sites; top 3 scored using spiritual-geometric overlays and anomaly detection.

## Tools
- Python, GeoPandas, GPT-4.1, Google Earth Engine

## License
